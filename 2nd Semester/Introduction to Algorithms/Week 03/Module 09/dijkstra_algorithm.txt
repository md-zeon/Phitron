Dijkstra Algorithm Concept:
The Dijkstra algorithm is a well-known algorithm in graph theory for finding the shortest path between nodes in
a graph. It was conceived by Dutch computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra in 195
9. The algorithm works by maintaining a priority queue of nodes to visit, where the priority of each
node is its minimum distance from the source node. The algorithm iteratively selects the node with the
minimum priority (i.e., the node with the shortest distance from the source) and updates the distances
of its neighboring nodes.

Dijkstra Algorithm Steps:
1.  Initialize the distance to the source node as 0 and all other nodes as infinity.
2.  Create a priority queue and add the source node to it.
3.  While the priority queue is not empty:
*   Dequeue the node with the minimum priority (i.e., the node with the shortest
distance from the source
*   For each neighbor of the dequeued node that has not been visited yet:
*   Calculate the tentative distance from the source to the neighbor through the dequeued node
*   If the calculated distance is less than the current distance to the neighbor, update the distance to
the neighbor
*   Add the neighbor to the priority queue if it has not been visited before
4.  Once the priority queue is empty, the shortest distances from the source to all other nodes
are stored in the distance array.
