Algorithm add (a, n)
{
    sum = 0;
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        sum = sum + a[i]
    }
    return sum
}

Analyze:
The code defines a function `add` that takes an array `a` and an integer `n
The function uses a for loop to iterate over the array `a` from index 0 to `n-1
The function calculates the sum of the elements in the array `a` using the variable `sum
The function returns the calculated sum

Time Complexity:
The time complexity of the code is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array

Space Complexity:
The space complexity of the code is O(1), as it only uses a constant amount of space
