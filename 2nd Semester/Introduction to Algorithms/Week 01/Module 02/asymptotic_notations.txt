Asymptotic Notations:
The following notations are used to describe the asymptotic behavior of functions:

Big-Oh Notation
Big-Omega Notation
Big-Theta Notation
The Big-Oh notation is used to describe the upper bound of a function's growth rate, while
Big-Omega notation is used to describe the lower bound of a function's growth rate. 
Big-Theta notation is used to describe the exact growth rate of a function.

Asymptotic Notations are used to describe the time and space complexity of algorithms. They provide
a way to express the upper and lower bounds of an algorithm's performance as the input size increases.
