Graph Traversal:
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)

Algorithm:
1. Create a graph with nodes and edges.
2. Choose a starting node (source node)
3. Perform DFS or BFS traversal from the source node
4. Mark visited nodes and keep track of the traversal order.

DFS:
1. Start at the source node
2. Explore as far as possible along each branch before backtracking
3. Mark visited nodes
4. Repeat steps 2-3 until all nodes are visited

BFS:
1. Start at the source node
2. Explore all nodes at the current level before moving to the next level
3. Mark visited nodes
4. Repeat steps 2-3 until all nodes are visited
