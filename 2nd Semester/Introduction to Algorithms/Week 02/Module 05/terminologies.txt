# Graph Terminologies
## Definitions

### Graph
A non-linear data structure consisting of nodes/vertices connected by edges.

### Node/Vertex
A point in a graph that represents a data point.

### Edge
A connection between two nodes/vertices.

### Neighbor
A node/vertex that is directly connected to another node/vertex by an edge.

### Degree
The number of edges connected to a node/vertex.

### Weighted Graph
A graph where each edge has a weight or label associated with it.

### Unweighted Graph
A graph where each edge has no weight or label associated with it.

### Directed Graph
A graph where each edge has a direction associated with it.

### Undirected Graph
A graph where each edge does not have a direction associated with it.

### Simple Graph
A graph where there is at most one edge between any two nodes/vertices.

### Cycle
A path that starts and ends at the same node/vertex.

### Path
A sequence of nodes/vertices connected by edges.

### Connected Graph
A graph where there is a path between every pair of nodes/vertices.

### Disconnected Graph
A graph where there is no path between at least one pair of nodes/vertices.

### Subgraph
A graph that is a subset of a larger graph.

### Spanning Tree
A subgraph that is a tree and contains all the nodes/vertices of the original graph.

### Shortest Path
The minimum-weight path between two nodes/vertices in a weighted graph.

### Topological Sort
A linear ordering of nodes/vertices in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) such that for every edge (u, v), node u comes before node v in the ordering.

### Additional Definitions

### Adjacency Matrix
A matrix representation of a graph where the entry at row i and column j represents the weight of the edge between node i and node j.

### Adjacency List
A list representation of a graph where each node is associated with a list of its neighboring nodes.

### Graph Isomorphism
Two graphs are said to be isomorphic if there is a one-to-one correspondence between their nodes and edges.

### Graph Homomorphism
A mapping between two graphs that preserves the edge structure.

### Strongly Connected Graph
A graph where there is a path from every node to every other node.

### Weakly Connected Graph
A graph where there is a path from every node to every other node, ignoring the direction of edges.

### Special Graph (Tree)
A connected graph with no cycles. No. of edges = (No. of vertices - 1)
